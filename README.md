# adhd_journal_flutter

ADHD Journal app for iOS 

This application is a port of the ADHD Journal Android App. It is developed using Flutter and Swift.

Purpose:
The application is designed to help people with ADHD journal things that take place in their lives that are being affected by their symptoms. This is useful for symptom management, jotting down important things, counseling, and more. I designed it because I myself have ADHD and needed an easier way to journal things going on in my life so I could see where things were headed for me in terms of treating my own ADHD. Let's make the world more ADHD Friendly one step at a time.
